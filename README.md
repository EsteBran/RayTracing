# RayTracing1.0

Following Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend / Next Week / Rest of your Life" books 
to learn about ray tracing and implement a cpu-based unidirectional ray-tracer.
So far it can calculate intersections with a sphere in 3 dimensions and show a representation
of the sphere coloured according to its normal vectors (per pixel).
